  <a>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a>So I had found a iPhone couple years ago brand new, it was just on the street. Their was no password so I could get into, I couldve just kept it and reset it. Instead I went into contacts and called the "Mum" contact number. I told her that I had found this phone on the street. She said it was her sons, I told her to meet the gas station so she and her son can pick it up. They were happy and gave me $50.  </a>

  <br>
  <a> Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity. </a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a>I initially acquired the values and identities from my family. I can identify the facets of my values and identity that I needed to let go of or reassess. The people I am surrounded by and the environment in which I live and work can then have an impact on me and cause me to acquire new values and aspects of my identity. I can see how I have evolved and diverged as I've become older when I think back to my family. </a>

  <br>
  <a>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.  </a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a>I work incredibly hard and don't give up lightly. I'm always willing to pick up new skills. I'm always seeking to get better. I also maintain discipline and avoid being sidetracked. These traits, in my opinion, will enable me to be successful in both my academic and general life </a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a>As a newcomer, I find it difficult to complete tasks on time since I require a lot of time to learn and practise, but with my family's help, I am able to devote more time. Speaking about limits, I believe that I am not able to adequately describe myself for core because this technique is unfamiliar to me. Despite this, I am making an effort to make it work, and I am confident that with more practise, I will be able to overcome this limitation during this course.</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a>Although this has never happened to me before, if it does in the future, I will pay close attention to the other person's perspective and also try to express my own perspective based on my observation or knowledge, in the hopes that our dialogues will result in a mutually acceptable solution. It's crucial under these circumstances to avoid letting ego get in the way of productive dialogue.</a>
