  <a> A story about a time I was blocked on a simple problem.</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> I have to use a loop to generate this function. It was intended for me to assign a value from the array of scores to each attribute I would build for each student I obtained from the array. I kept attempting to add the property using the Object.key = array, which obviously gave an error, because I was unaware that I had to first build the student object. I struggled for a while to understand this. I took a short break, and when I returned, I could clearly see what had gone wrong. I discovered that even when I believe I understand something thoroughly, I am capable of making mistakes, so I should use problem-solving techniques to fix them.</a>

  <br>
  <a> In order to solve this issue, I needed to add a win to each element of an array inside of a for loop. This win property was intended to be a console-logging function expression.  I was able to figure out why the code I wrote wasn't functioning. I thought I handled this issue neatly. The notion of this issue was somewhat complex, and it took some research to come to a clear understanding. As a result, I believe I have learned more than from any other straightforward issue I have been with in the past, and I felt terrific about it.</a>
