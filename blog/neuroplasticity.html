  <a>How does understanding principles of Neuroplasticity benefit people?  Neuroplasticity is the ability of our brains to learn new things. It’s our brain’s malleability in response to our behavior and environment. Understanding this would help us engage in activities that will contribute to our holistic well-being no matter our age. </a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> How will I engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my benefit?  I am doing this web development course, I feel like my brain cells are working extra hard to retain new information. I believe that I can get smarter, better or more skilled at this through sustained effort.  </a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> Some ways to increase neuroplasticity.  1. Play video games - when you play a new game, you teach your brain new skills. Benefits associated with gaming include motor coordination, visual recognition, memory and reaction time, resilience and team participation.  2. Exercise- can lead to improvements in cognitive abilities like learning and memory. This also helps improve fine motor coordination and brain connectivity. 3. Make some music - this helps improve your mood, concentration and focus. Also your ability to learn and remember new information.   </a>

  <a> What is a growth mindset? And why is it important? A growth mindset is a term we often associate with education, especially when we look for ways to improve in our academics. It is believed that intelligence and abilities can be developed through hard work and dedication. Having this kind of mindset will make you realise that you can improve or learn more when you work hard for it. It is important because it can help you surpass difficulties that comes with learning something new or when you are trying to develop a new skill. Having a growth mindset will instill the importance of perseverance and determination.</a>

  <br>
  <a> Any surprises or changes after exploring about growth mindset?  I usually strive to view things positively, and that goes for the experiences I am having right now while attending Dev Academy. But after learning more about the growth mentality, I believe it has bolstered my resolve to push through all the sprints and complete bootcamp.</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> How will I integrate growth mindset into my learning journey?  My desire to finish this course with a good effort has increased since learning about the development mindset. I find going through the sprints to be so difficult that I start to doubt my ability to check off all the necessary learning criteria. I am now certain that if I put a lot of work into my studies, I will eventually be able to do more. If I find a subject challenging, I'll tell myself that with lots of practise, I can learn and master it.</a>
