  <a> What is your long term goal or career pathway? Being able to pursue a profession as a web developer is my long-term objective. I wish to get knowledgeable in the field, technology, or language. I was hoping to find a position with opportunities for advancement, minimal danger of getting laid off, and increased job satisfaction overall.</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> My strengths and limitations when it comes to learning. My strength is when I want to finish a task I will put everything into and get it done. My limitations will be getting distracted if I can't get the task finished. </a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> Effective communication skills, the capacity for self-learning, the capacity for creativity, and the ability to overcome obstacles are the non-technical abilities I would like to acquire throughout my time spent learning at Dev Academy. I want to become more comfortable speaking up for myself and expressing myself to others. I want to develop my creativity and my ability to think creatively. Most essential, I need to develop the acceptance that I will frequently fall into the rabbit hole, but that I must press on until I accomplish my objectives.. </a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> When I get stuck, I will look back on previous resources, research for more information online or check the relevant threads in discord because there might be someone who already asked the same query. If I still donâ€™t get it, I will ask my fellow classmates and facilitators for help.  </a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> I anticipate that the facilitators will interact with us and lead us by having a few check-ins or catch-ups to assess how we are progressing with our learning. additionally to assist us by continuously offering feedback on our work.</a>
