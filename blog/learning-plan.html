  <a> What is your long term goal or career pathway? Being able to pursue a profession as a web developer is my long-term objective. I wish to get knowledgeable in the field, technology, or language. I was hoping to find a position with opportunities for advancement, minimal danger of getting laid off, and increased job satisfaction overall.</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> My strengths and limitations when it comes to learning. My strength is when I want to finish a task I will put everything into and get it done. My limitations will be getting distracted if I can't get the task finished. </a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> Effective communication skills, the capacity for self-learning, the capacity for creativity, and the ability to overcome obstacles are the non-technical abilities I would like to acquire throughout my time spent learning at Dev Academy. I want to become more comfortable speaking up for myself and expressing myself to others. I want to develop my creativity and my ability to think creatively. Most essential, I need to develop the acceptance that I will frequently fall into the rabbit hole, but that I must press on until I accomplish my objectives.. </a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> When I get stuck, I will look back on previous resources, research for more information online or check the relevant threads in discord because there might be someone who already asked the same query. If I still donâ€™t get it, I will ask my fellow classmates and facilitators for help.  </a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> I anticipate that the facilitators will interact with us and lead us by having a few check-ins or catch-ups to assess how we are progressing with our learning. additionally to assist us by continuously offering feedback on our work.</a>

  <a> Bootcamp Learning Plan  </a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?  </a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> I continue to have the same long-term goal of being a successful web developer. I want to acquire the abilities and information need to succeed. That entails having an understanding of computer and software systems as well as the necessary proficiency in programming languages and methodologies to keep up with contemporary advancements and market demands.</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> My greatest assets are that I'm tenacious, don't give up easily, and that I'm currently very interested in learning how to code. I believe I am quite well-prepared for the bootcamp and am not currently aware of any limits.</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> I am aware that there is a lot to learn and that it will take more than 60 to 70 hours of study. I'm hoping I can manage this burden and stay healthy for the next two months or so.</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> I consider myself to be a good team player. Working in groups is fun for me. However, I've never worked in a setting where I had to code in larger groups or pairs. If programming is any different from other environments, I hope to see improved teamwork and communication.</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</a>
  <br>
  <br> 
  <br>
  <a> I anticipate that the mentors on the Bootcamp team will be skilled and enthusiastic individuals who genuinely care about how our careers develop. You would anticipate an approachable and amiable tutor during your educational adventure.</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> Knowing how demanding the bootcamp can be, I'll ask my peers and the facilitators for assistance and keep track of how much time I've been spending on each task so that I can proactively manage my time and burden. Additionally, I'll make a note of any topics I believe I need to learn more about and review them on my own time at home.</a>
