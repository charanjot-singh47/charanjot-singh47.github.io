  <a> JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS. JavaScript's relationship to HTML and CSS can be explained simply by saying that HTML determines the framework of a webpage, CSS is used to style or beautify that structure, and JavaScript is in charge of the "activity" that takes place on the webpage.</a>

  <a> HTML is the framework of the house; it is the code that instructs the computer as to the layout of the page and the placement of various elements therein.  CSS adds a layer of paint, window treatments, tile, and carpet to style the house.  JavaScript is the code that makes your home smart and practical so that you may live comfortably. It is like the wiring, plumbing, and gas lines in your home.</a>

  <a> The computer specifies a code's execution order through control flow, typically top-down unless the code control diverges when it encounters other structures. The loops are one example. A conditional statement that repeats the specified task up until the given condition is satisfied is known as a loop. Consider the following as we build a table. To create it, we would need to adhere to certain guidelines, and we would do so until it was completed.</a>

  <a> Programmers can access and alter a document's content, structure, and style using the Document Object Model, a platform and interface. It refers to interacting with HTML document objects. By modifying the DOM, you can add, remove, or style elements without having to reload the page. To manipulate the DOM, a variety of methods and properties can be employed.</a>

  <a> Arrays & Objects.  Data is stored in both objects and arrays. A unique, mutable data type called an object is used to store a collection of data. On the other hand, arrays are a unique class of mutable variables that are used to hold lists of values.</a>

  <a> A function is a set of code that programmers use that are designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function can only be executed when you “call” it (something that invokes it). It is helpful because you can use the function code over and over again, rather than writing it multiple times. Also it enables programmers to breakdown a problem into smaller pieces, each of which performs a particular task.</a>
