  <a> What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning? </a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> Learning about neuroplasticity has given me the courage to persevere through challenging activities and the self-assurance to trust that, as neuroplasticity describes, my brain is ready to adapt and develop. Practicing Always Pays Off. I now understand how having a growth mentality gives you the freedom to do whatever you want, whenever you want. Finally, I have discovered that it is acceptable to seek assistance when necessary and that it is also acceptable to lack knowledge because learning is always a good thing even if you don't know everything.</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a>  What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> Â Morals and empathy help you recognise the issues that others are experiencing, while self-awareness helps you recognise what you lack and when to seek assistance. These work together to produce an effective environment for problem-solving, learning, and programming.</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> Learning about the idea of neuroplasticity and the fact that EQ is just as important if not more than IQ in terms of professional success and achievement</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</a>
  <br>s
  <br>
  <a> I personally think that core learning is more difficult than technical learning because it requires spending more time thinking about conceptual issues as opposed to seeing, reading, and creating codes.</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> I believe the reason is that while it is simple to identify and educate someone how to understand and write code, it is really challenging to find people who are compassionate, kind, and able to put themselves in others' situations. As they contribute to a healthy, productive, and constructive work atmosphere, these individuals are acknowledged as being more significant than those who merely possess excellent technical aptitude.</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer. </a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a> In the beginning I wondered, what is the point with all these core learnings while I thought I would be taught on how to code however it did not take long for me to realize the importance of the nature and ever since then I have spent as equal amount of time building on my fundamental core aspect of properties.</a>
